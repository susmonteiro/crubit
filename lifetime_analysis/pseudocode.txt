STEP 1: 

STEP 2: Given a points-to set, return the lifetime
    - object repository: 
        - repository for the objects used in the lifetime analysis of a single function
        - establishes a relationship between AST nodes and the objects that represent them
        - it is not part of the lattice (does not store states that change during the analysis)
    - points-to set
    - constraints: applied to the lifetimes
    - lifetime substitutions: built from the function's body
1. get original function lifetimes, from the object repository
    - find out about this
- apply the constraints to the function lifetimes
    - also see what this means
- diagnose return local
    - find out about this



ValueLifetimes: class that represents the lifetimes of a value
    - non-reference-like types  -> 0
    - pointers/references       -> 1
    - structs with template arguments/
        lifetime parameters     -> arbitrary

    - lifetimes are created in *post-order* in the tree of lifetimes
